        <p><strong>My education</strong>
            <br>Hi there! I'm a Kenyan student who's had the privilege of attending several
            <br> fantastic schools in different parts of the country.
            <br> I began my academic journey at State House Primary in Nairobi,
            <br> where I gained a strong foundation in education. From there,
            <br> I moved on to <b>Winners Academy </b> in Garrissa, where I learned more about
            <br> the unique cultures and traditions of different communities in Kenya.
            <br> After that, I attended <b>Plainsville Academy</b>  in Meru, where I had the
            <br> opportunity to meet new people and experience life in a way.
            <br> Finally, I ended up at <b>Mang'u High School </b>in Kiambu, where I continued
            <br> to expand my knowledge and skills and prepare for the next chapter of my life.
            <br>Throughout my school years, I've also been involved in a variety of 
            <br>co-curricular activities, including <b>drama</b> and <b>rugby</b>.
            <br> Rugby has taught me the importance of teamwork, leadership, and perseverance,
            <br> and I'm proud to have received recognition for my performance on the field.
            <br> Meanwhile, drama has given me the opportunity to explore my creative side
            <br> and improve my public speaking and communication skills.
            <br> I've won numerous awards for my achievements in these activities,
            <br> which is a testament to the hard work and dedication I've put into them.
            <br>Looking back on my journey so far, I'm grateful for the opportunities,
            <br> I've had and the experiences I've gained. I believe that my diverse
            <br> background and experiences have prepared me well for
            <br> the future, whatever it may hold.I'm excited to continue exploring my
            <br> passions and interests and making a positive impact in the world around me
